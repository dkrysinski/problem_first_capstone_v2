# üì¢ Push Notification System - RegTech AI v2

## Overview

The Push Notification System transforms RegTech AI from reactive to proactive compliance assistance. Instead of waiting for users to ask questions, the system analyzes new regulatory documents and automatically identifies which users would be impacted, generating personalized email notifications.

## üéØ Business Value

This system demonstrates how enterprise RegTech solutions work in practice:

- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Monitor and analyze new regulations automatically
- **Client Segmentation**: Identify which clients are affected by specific changes
- **Proactive Outreach**: Generate personalized notifications before clients even know about new requirements
- **Revenue Generation**: Enable proactive consulting and compliance services

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Document Analyzer** (`src/langchain_modules/document_analyzer.py`)
   - Extracts text from PDF/text documents
   - Uses AI to analyze regulatory content and extract key information
   - Identifies frameworks, topics, geographic scope, and requirements

2. **User Impact Scoring** 
   - Calculates relevance scores for each user based on:
     - Regulatory framework overlap (high weight)
     - Industry matching (high weight) 
     - Geographic relevance (medium weight)
     - Topic tag matching (medium weight)
   - Scores range from 0.0 to 1.0

3. **Email Generation**
   - Creates personalized emails using user profile context
   - Includes document summary, key requirements, and specific relevance
   - Professional tone with actionable insights

4. **Streamlit Interface** (`src/streamlit_app/push_notifications.py`)
   - Document upload and analysis
   - User impact visualization
   - Email generation and preview
   - Bulk processing capabilities

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
./activate_env.sh
streamlit run src/streamlit_app/app.py
```

### 2. Navigate to Push Notifications Tab
- Open the web interface
- Click on the "üì¢ Push Notifications" tab

### 3. Upload a Document
- Click "Choose a regulatory document"
- Upload a PDF or text file containing new regulatory information
- Adjust impact score threshold (default: 0.2)

### 4. Analyze Impact
- Click "üîç Analyze Document & Identify Impacted Users"
- The system will:
  - Extract and analyze document content
  - Identify regulatory frameworks and topics
  - Score impact for all users in the system
  - Display results sorted by impact score

### 5. Generate Notifications
- Review impacted users and their relevance reasons
- Click "üìß Generate Email" for individual users
- Use "üìß Generate Emails for All Impacted Users" for bulk processing
- Copy email content to send to users

## üìä Sample Analysis

### Document Analysis Results
- **Frameworks**: EXEC_ORDER, DORA
- **Topic Tags**: cybersecurity, financial, compliance, data-transfers, AI-ML
- **Geographic Scope**: us
- **Industry Focus**: financial, technology
- **Summary**: New cybersecurity requirements for financial institutions

### User Impact Scoring Example

**marie.dubois@banquecentrale.fr** (Impact: 0.85)
- ‚úÖ Framework match: DORA (financial services)
- ‚úÖ Industry match: Financial 
- ‚úÖ Geographic relevance: EU (cross-border implications)
- ‚úÖ Topic relevance: cybersecurity, compliance, financial

**john.smith@techstartup.com** (Impact: 0.45)
- ‚úÖ Topic relevance: AI-ML, technology, data-processing
- ‚úÖ Geographic relevance: US operations
- ‚ùå Lower framework overlap

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Impact Score Threshold
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Broad relevance (high volume, lower precision)
- **0.3 - 0.6**: Moderate relevance (balanced)
- **0.6 - 1.0**: High relevance (focused, high precision)

### Bulk Processing Limits
- Maximum 10 users for bulk email generation
- Prevents system overload while demonstrating capability

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Document Analysis Pipeline

1. **Text Extraction**: Extract content from PDF/text files
2. **AI Analysis**: Use GPT-4 to analyze regulatory content
3. **Structured Output**: Extract frameworks, topics, requirements using Pydantic models
4. **User Matching**: Score relevance against all user profiles
5. **Email Generation**: Create personalized notifications using templates

### Scoring Algorithm

```python
impact_score = (
    framework_overlap_weight +    # 0.0 - 0.6
    industry_match_weight +       # 0.0 - 0.25  
    geographic_match_weight +     # 0.0 - 0.15
    topic_overlap_weight +        # 0.0 - 0.20
    business_relevance_weight     # 0.0 - 0.10
)
```

### User Profile Integration

The system leverages the enhanced user memory system:
- **Industry and company context**
- **Regulatory framework focus** 
- **Historical topic tags and patterns**
- **Geographic location**
- **Past interaction patterns**

## üéØ Real-World Applications

This POC demonstrates capabilities that enterprise RegTech platforms use:

### Law Firms
- Monitor new regulations affecting client industries
- Generate client alerts for billable advisory work
- Demonstrate proactive value to retain clients

### Compliance Consultancies  
- Scale monitoring across multiple regulatory frameworks
- Provide timely updates to subscription clients
- Identify upsell opportunities for implementation services

### Enterprise Legal Departments
- Stay ahead of regulatory changes in relevant jurisdictions
- Prioritize compliance efforts based on business impact
- Coordinate cross-functional response to new requirements

## üìà Success Metrics

The system provides analytics on:
- **Document Processing**: Time to analyze and categorize new regulations
- **User Matching Accuracy**: Precision of impact scoring
- **Engagement**: Which notifications generate the most user interaction
- **Business Value**: Revenue from proactive vs reactive services

## üîß Development Notes

### Adding New Analysis Capabilities
- Extend `DocumentImpactResponse` model for new fields
- Update analysis prompt template
